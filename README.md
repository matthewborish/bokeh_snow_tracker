# bokeh_snow_tracker

This repository contains code to scrape Tony Crocker's Ski Season Progress Reports (https://bestsnow.net/seas19.htm), and convert them to Bokeh bar charts. Ouput is saved as an .html file, which you can download and open with a browser or view and interact with here: https://matthewborish.github.io/. A static sample image is pictured below.
